<p>When a Judge orders an evaluation of a court-involved youth, the following takes place:</p>
<ol><li>The Judge informs the youth, family, and attorney in court that a Court Clinic evaluation has been ordered.</li><li>The Judge and probation officer complete a referral form and submit it to the Juvenile Court Clinic, along with information from the probation intake process.</li><li>The Juvenile Court Clinic assigns the case to a Juvenile Court Clinician. &nbsp;Depending upon the number of cases referred at a particular time, the assignment may not occur for several weeks after the receipt of the referral from the court.</li><li>The clinician will contact both the attorney and the family/guardians of the youth to notify them of their assignment. &nbsp;The clinician will also set up an initial appointment to meet with the youth and family/guardian. The attorney may or may not be present for this appointment, depending upon the wishes of the youth and family/guardian.</li><li>During the initial appointment, the clinician will meet with the youth and his/her family or guardians. &nbsp;The clinician will explain the evaluation process and also gather information from the youth and family members present. &nbsp;The clinician will ask a parent/guardian to sign releases of information so that she/he may contact outside sources to collect additional information related to the youth. &nbsp;These sources may include school personnel, outside counselors, or psychologists, hospitals, and medical doctors.</li><li>After the initial meeting, the clinician may schedule additional appointments. &nbsp;The clinician will likely schedule a time to meet separately with just the youth and also a time to meet separately with just the parent/guardian. &nbsp;Again, the purpose of these meetings will be to gather information to prepare a report for the Court.</li><li>The clinician will then prepare a report to be submitted to the Court for the youth's next court date. &nbsp;The report will contain information gathered during the evaluation process, in addition to recommendations to help the youth and family. &nbsp;Prior to submitting the evaluation to the court, the clinician will review the recommendations with the parent/guardian.</li><li>The completed report is the property of the Court and is filed with the Clerk Magistrate. &nbsp;It can only be released with a Judge's order.</li><li>If additional assistance in accessing services is needed, the clinician may do follow-up work with the youth and family once the case has been heard in Court. &nbsp;For more information about what happens after an evaluation is completed, see our page on<font><font color="#00aaff">&nbsp;</font><a href="education-and-advocacy.php"><font color="#00aaff">Education</font><font color="#33bbff"> and Advocacy.</font></a><font color="#33bbff">&nbsp;</font></font></li></ol>
