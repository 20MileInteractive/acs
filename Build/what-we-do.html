		  	        <h3>Evaluations</h3>
		  	        <p>
		  	        	Individual child and adolescent evaluations are the foundation of our services.The clinicians develop recommendations in conjunction with the child and thfamily.  What we learn throughout the evaluation process becomes the basis foclinical recommendations to the court such as specialized testing, treatmenteducation, advocacy, and follow-up.

		  	        <h5>Emergency Evaluations of Suicidal Youth</h5>
		  	        <p>
		  	        	A clinician is called into court to evaluate whether a child requires hospital-level care due to a risk of self-harm or a risk of harming others.  Many children appear before the Court with critical or emergency needs, for example, an evaluation of a 14-year-old girl who had been on the run for six weeks and told her court-appointed attorney that she wanted to kill herself "because nobody cares."
		  	        </p>
		  	        <h5>Comprehensive Psychosocial Evaluations</h5>
		  	        <p>
		  	        	A clinician interviews the child and family, gathers collateral information, and submits a confidential report to the Judge.  For example, this type of evaluation has uncovered the undiagnosed learning disability of a 13-year-old boy who was arrested for stealing.  Since his mother was deceased and his father had been recently incarcerated, the ACS clinician worked with social services to match the boy with an appropriate living situation with other family members, to develop an educational plan, and find a mentor in the community.

		  	        <p>
		  	        	A clinician interviews the child and family, gathers collateral information, and submits a confidential report to the Judge.  For example, this type of evaluation has uncovered the undiagnosed learning disability of a 13-year-old boy who was arrested for stealing.
