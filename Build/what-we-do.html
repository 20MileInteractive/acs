		  	    <div class="content" data-section-content>
		  	        <h3>Evaluations</h3>
		  	        <p>
		  	        	Individual child and adolescent evaluations are the foundation of our services.The clinicians develop recommendations in conjunction with the child and thfamily.  What we learn throughout the evaluation process becomes the basis foclinical recommendations to the court such as specialized testing, treatmenteducation, advocacy, and follow-up.
		  	        </p>
		  	        <h5>Emergency Evaluations of Suicidal Youth</h5>
		  	        <p>
		  	        	A clinician is called into court to evaluate whether a child requires hospital-level care due to a risk of self-harm or a risk of harming others.  Many children appear before the Court with critical or emergency needs, for example, an evaluation of a 14-year-old girl who had been on the run for six weeks and told her court-appointed attorney that she wanted to kill herself "because nobody cares."
		  	        </p>
		  	        <h5>Comprehensive Psychosocial Evaluations</h5>
		  	        <p>
		  	        	A clinician interviews the child and family, gathers collateral information, and submits a confidential report to the Judge.  For example, this type of evaluation has uncovered the undiagnosed learning disability of a 13-year-old boy who was arrested for stealing.  Since his mother was deceased and his father had been recently incarcerated, the ACS clinician worked with social services to match the boy with an appropriate living situation with other family members, to develop an educational plan, and find a mentor in the community.
		  	        </p>
		  	        <h5>Specialized Evaluations</h5>
		  	        <p>
		  	        	ACS has expertise in highly specialized areas where careful evaluations are necessary to protect the child and the community. This includes violence risk, substance abuse, sexual offending, and firesetting behavior.

		  	    <div class="content" data-section-content>
		  	        <h3>Specialized Testing</h3>
		  	        <p>
		  	        	While completing an evaluation, clinicians often have specific questions about a child's psychological processes, neuropsychological functioning, and/or learning capabilities.	
		  	        </p>
		  	        <p>
		  	        	Sometimes, the complex issues that affect psychological functioning are hard to distinguish throughout the interview process and may also not be answered through a review of the child's history or records.  In these cases, we can provide psychological testing to complete the diagnostic picture.

		  	    <div class="content" data-section-content>
		  	        <h3>Education &amp; Advocacy</h3>
		  	        <p>
		  	        	In 2002, we began the Education and Advocacy Program.  This program provides expanded services for clients by including additional time in the evaluation process for clinicians to:
		  	        </p>
		  	        <ul>
		  	        	<li>
		  	        		Provide information and education sessions with youth andfamilies that will help them understand the need for treatmentand how to obtain it
		  	        	</li>
		  	        	<li>
		  	        		Develop linkages with community service providers to help youthand families obtain treatment
		  	        	</li>
		  	        	<li>
		  	        		Provide follow-up for youth and families to help ensure that theyconnect with recommended services
		  	        	</li>
		  	        </ul>
		  	        <p>
		  	        	The goal of the Education and Advocacy program is to strengthen theresiliency of children and families, helping to make sure they havethe tools they need to manage every day difficulties.  Cliniciansleverage public and private resources to find services for vulnerableyouth within their communities.  Individually tailored responses,which take into account the urgent and comprehensive needs of thechild and family, are what lead to success. 
		  	       	</p>
		  	        <h5>The Education and Advocacy Process</h5>
		  	        <p>
		  	        	Clinicians provide a variety of services throughout the Education and Advocacy period, among which include:
		  	        </p>		  	       	
		  	        <ul>
		  	        	<li>
		  	        		Educating youth and families about issues identified in the evaluation process, such as learning needs, mental illness, or substance abuse
		  	        	</li>
		  	        	<li>
		  	        		Advocating for the clients and linking them with community services, such as medical care, mental health treatment, or in-home support for the family
		  	        	</li>
		  	        	<li>
		  	        		Following up with clients and providers to help ensure that clients are actually getting the recommended services
		  	        	</li>
		  	        </ul>

		  	<section>
		  	    <p class="title" data-section-title><a href="#">Therapeutic Services</a></p>
		  	    <div class="content" data-section-content>
		  	    	<h3>Therapeutic Services</h3>
		  	        <h5>Individual and Family Therapy</h5>
		  	        <p>
		  	        	We always seek to match youth and families with the services that meet their specific needs.  This is often challenging when families have very few resources available in their communities.  In particular, accessible and affordable therapy for individuals or families is often nonexistent or frustratingly elusive.
		  	        </p>
		  	        <p>
		  	        	Our affiliation with the Court and relationship with Juvenile Probation enables us to engage youth and families who would not otherwise receive services.  We provide both short- and long-term counseling, which is frequently made a condition of probation.  We also work with family members to facilitate changes family-wide.
		  	        </p>
		  	        <h5>Group Education and Treatment</h5>
		  	        <p>
		  	        	Group counseling is one of the most effective ways to engage teens in treatment. Attendance and participation in ACS psychoeducational groups are required as a part of probation for these youth. The groups are led by an ACS clinician. ACS offers the following groups based on referrals from the Court:
		  	        </p>
		  	        <ul>
		  	        	<li>
		  	        		Young Men's Group
		  	        	</li>
		  	        	<li>
		  	        		Anger Management Group
		  	        	</li>
		  	        	<li>
		  	        		Young Women's Group
		  	        	</li>
		  	        	<li>
		  	        		Motherhood Group
		  	        	</li>
		  	        </ul>
		  	        <p>
		  	        	The groups provide a unique opportunity for the teens to express their concerns about the Court process, as well as learn valuable life skills to turn their lives around. 
		  	        </p>
		  	        <p>
		  	        	A recent graduate of the Life Skills Group for Young Men said: “I was born into an evil family, grew up in an evil neighborhood, and I just don’t want to be evil anymore.”  Another participant remarked, “If you’re doing something, don’t be surprised when there are consequences.”
		  	        </p>
		  	        <p> 
		  	        	The Young Men's Group, Anger Management Group, and Young Women's Group focus on skills training, and are co-led by a clinician and a graduate student intern.

		  	    	<h3>Community Consultations</h3>
		  	        <p>
		  	        	 ACS Clinicians have strong ties with a wide network of community providers and schools.  Members of the community often turn to ACS for consultation on questions ranging from basic court procedures to specific mental health services.  Often, these consultations head off a potentially dangerous issue or can assist a troubled family in finding the help they need.

		  	        <p>
		  	        	 ACS serves as a training site for child psychiatry fellows, as well as social work and psychology trainees.  Training consists of conducting evaluations on youth and family members through individual and family interviews, writing comprehensive reports with recommendations for the Court, observing Court, and testifying on assigned cases.
