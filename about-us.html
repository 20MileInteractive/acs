	    <p>ACS operates juvenile court clinics at the Juvenile Court offices in Cambridge, Lowell, Framingham and Waltham. As client families are attempting to maneuver through the county’s juvenile court system, onsite court clinic offices enable ACS to engage clients at the point when positive outcomes are still possible—even for kids that are experiencing the most adverse circumstances.</p>
