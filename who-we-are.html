		<h3>Who We Are</h3>
		<p>
			The mission of Adolescent Consultation Services (ACS) is to support and empower children and families involved with the Juvenile Court.  We provide compassionate care through comprehensive mental health evaluations, individual and group therapy, and targeted education and advocacy to the Court and to community service providers.  Our specially-trained clinicians educate and strengthen at-risk youth and their families to help them make good choices, cultivate healthy relationships, stay out of lockup, and connect with the resources they need to live full, productive lives.
		</p>
		<p>
			ACS was developed in 1973 in response to the specialized needs of court-involved adolescents, focusing on their undiagnosed learning needs.  In 1998, based on our strong track record, the Massachusetts Juvenile Court awarded us the contract to provide Juvenile Court Clinic services throughout Middlesex County. In partnership with the Juvenile Court, our clinicians evaluate children and their families to understand their needs and to bring together the resources necessary to find real solutions to their underlying problems.
