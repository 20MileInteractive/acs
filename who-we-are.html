		<h3>Who We Are</h3>
		<p>
			The mission of Adolescent Consultation Services (ACS) is to support and empower children and families involved with the Juvenile Court.  We provide compassionate care through comprehensive mental health evaluations, individual and group therapy, and targeted education and advocacy to the Court and to community service providers.  Our specially-trained clinicians educate and strengthen at-risk youth and their families to help them make good choices, cultivate healthy relationships, stay out of lockup, and connect with the resources they need to live full, productive lives.
