			ACS clinicians are what make ACS unique. Juvenile Court Clinicians provide emergency and comprehensive evaluations that take into account biological, psychological and social factors of some of the most vulnerable children involved with the Juvenile Court. All Juvenile Court Clinicians are certified* and specially trained in the issues impacting court-involved youth and families including complex trauma, mental health diagnoses, substance abuse, learning disabilities and cultural issues.
